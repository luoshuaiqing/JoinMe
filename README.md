## About the website ##
Two ways to explore my project:<br/>
1. Login
  * Please use the following accounts as *employers* to use post job functionality
    * amazon@google.com
    * google2@gmail.com
    * apple@gmail.com
    * google@gmail.com
2.Sign Up
  * Please use the following accounts as *normal users* to search job and talk with employers
    * employee@gmail.com
    * sylviawei0923@gmail.com
  * The verification code is joinmeus and is already prefilled in the signup form. However, you can still test the email verification functionality by entering a valid email account. Your email will receive the verification code within 30 seconds, which is "joinmeus" for easier testing reasons.
  * For signup page, I have already prefilled in some information to save you some time. Whatever information I didnot fill in is expected to really show up on some of the pages, so please fill them up yourself to gain a better visual effect. 
    * The only exception is the image url, which will also show up in the chatting room as your profile picture. However, I have also prefilled the image url for you to save the time of finding an image online. If you want to have a unique image, please use the image url of the format "https://xxx/xxx"
